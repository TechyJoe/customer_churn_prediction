This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation to improve prediction accuracy.
The final model is deployed using Flask, and insights are visualized through Power BI/Tableau dashboards. 
This solution helps telecom companies identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to improve retention.
